calc.sikuli is an example project. It doesn't contain the different sikuli projects like "aut, generic or repository".
All these are combined into one project, calc. 

This project automates the windows calculator... it is dumb and stupid, but it gives an impression on what it can do. 

Please change the paths where needed. (the logging and the run calculator). 

Cheers, and have fun with it.

p.s. add the "StartCalculator" actionword your self to the Excelsheet as an assignment. ;-)
